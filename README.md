# odin

Harmonising Chaos.

# Background

Android implementation of [Odin](https://github.com/ianhomer/odin)

# Build

Using IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio build APK.

Copy APK across to your Android device (I copy APK to Google drive to do this quickly) and then install app.

# Running

App is pretty basic at the moment, connects to ports on startup and fires a static MIDI sequence.  You can expect 
more soon.
